\en-abstract{
With the spread of IoT in research and application areas, the need for IoT cloud services has increased. Most companies and startups that are active in this field also operate only at the hardware and software development level and use cloud providers for data storage and processing. As with Internet of Things, serverless architecture is also evolving in software engineering where the cost and demand of servers is managed by the service provider and only the execution time of the functions is calculated. Also, developers do not need to consider infrastructure conditions and servers. The goal of the project is to set up a serverless platform for executing the functions and run processes of IoT networks, including receiving and analyzing sensor data and executing specific scenarios. This platform can be used by startups, universities, and IoT research centers.
